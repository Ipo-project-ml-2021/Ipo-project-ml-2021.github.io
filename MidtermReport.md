# Introduction/Background

For day traders and stock brokers, one of the most intriguing investments are companies selling their stock publicly for the first time (IPO, or Initial Public Offering). Because these stocks are new, and the companies relatively unproven, IPO stocks are much more volatile than stocks for established companies.  With the “extraordinarily high variability of initial returns” [1] there is increased opportunity; using machine learning techniques we will try to best capitalize on this volatility by predicting whether an IPO stock will increase or decrease in the first 5 days of trading.

# Problem Definition

With the controversy surrounding wall street and the stock market spiking recently, companies have more reason than ever to be fearful of going public. We seek to create a program to predict the change-in-price of an IPO after its first week on the market, to help smaller companies determine if going public is the right move for them.
